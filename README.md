# Emergency Response Mobile App for Vancouver

**Date:** May 24, 2024  
**Prepared for:** City of Vancouver

---

## Overview

This repository contains the project files and documentation for an innovative mobile application designed to enhance the City of Vancouver's emergency response capabilities. The application is structured around the key phases of the emergency management lifecycle: Mitigation, Response, and Recovery. This project aims to streamline resource allocation, improve volunteer management, and optimize disaster preparedness through advanced data analysis and user-friendly features.

## Key Features

### Mitigation Phase

- **Risk Level Mapping:**
  - **Risk Map:** Highlights areas with varying risk levels based on postal codes.
  - **Stockpile Alerts:** Notifies citizens about necessary food and water stockpiles based on upcoming threats.
  - **Facility Installation:** Guides the installation of emergency facilities according to area-specific risk levels.

### Response Phase

- **Resource Allocation:**
  - **Priority Model:** Utilizes diverse variables (e.g., vulnerable population, low-income households, one-person households, high-rise buildings) to calculate a priority score for resource distribution.
  - **Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP):** Employs AHP to weigh different factors and determine the priority score for each area, ensuring a balanced and effective allocation of resources.
  - **Prioritization Bar Chart:** Visualizes resource allocation priorities by area code, ensuring high-risk areas receive supplies first.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Population and Risk Analysis:** Determines that population alone is not a reliable metric for resource allocation, emphasizing a multifaceted approach.

### Recovery Phase

- **Volunteer Management:**
  - **Skill Availability:** Matches volunteer requests with available skills in nearby areas, ensuring efficient and effective volunteer deployment.
  - **Health Worker Concentration Map:** Shows the distribution of health workers by area code, aiding in targeted volunteer requests.
- **Proximity Analysis:** Ensures that volunteer requests are efficiently managed by considering proximity and skill availability.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to empower the City of Vancouver to:
- Effectively mitigate disaster consequences through strategic preparation.
- Optimize resource allocation and emergency response using data-driven methodologies.
- Enhance recovery efforts by efficiently managing volunteer resources.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. How can Vancouver prepare effectively to mitigate disaster consequences?
2. How can the city ensure effective emergency response using the mobile app?
3. How can Vancouver allocate supplies and resources efficiently immediately after a disaster?
4. How can the city recover effectively using volunteers?
